# EECS 837 - Final project

### About

This project reads lers-type files within the directory containing the python code and attempts to perform one of several discritizations on it:

* Global equal interval width
* Global equal frequency per interval
* Global conditional entropy

### Requirements

This program _should_ be compatible with both Python 2.x and 3.x. It is necessary 
to have both 
[```main.py```](https://github.com/RagingRoosevelt/eecs837_global-discretization/blob/master/main.py) 
and  
[```utility.py```](https://github.com/RagingRoosevelt/eecs837_global-discretization/blob/master/utility.py) 
in the same directory.  You should put any lers-type files in the same directory
as the two code files.  From there, simply run ```main.py``` and it should find
all ```.txt``` and ```.lers``` files.  It also has an option for manual filename 
entry for files in the same directory as the ```.py``` files.
